INNER JOIN (simple join)

Chances are, you've already written a statement that uses an Oracle INNER JOIN. It is the most common type of join. Oracle INNER JOINS return all rows from multiple tables where the join condition is met.

LEFT OUTER JOIN

Another type of join is called an Oracle LEFT OUTER JOIN. This type of join returns all rows from the LEFT-hand table specified in the ON condition and only those rows from the other table where the joined fields are equal (join condition is met).

RIGHT OUTER JOIN

Another type of join is called an Oracle RIGHT OUTER JOIN. This type of join returns all rows from the RIGHT-hand table specified in the ON condition and only those rows from the other table where the joined fields are equal (join condition is met).
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table

FULL OUTER JOIN

Another type of join is called an Oracle FULL OUTER JOIN. This type of join returns all rows from the LEFT-hand table and RIGHT-hand table with nulls in place where the join condition is not met.
